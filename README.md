# Pantry MCP Orchestrator

# Pantry MCP Orchestrator – Dinner Party Planner

This project is a small workshop to learn **mcp-agent** and the Model Context
Protocol (MCP) by building a fun multi-agent orchestrator.

The scenario: you have a `pantry/` folder with a list of ingredients. An
orchestrator coordinates specialist agents to:

- Read what's in your pantry (via the filesystem MCP server).
- Propose three candidate dinner menus.
- Choose the best one.
- Write a friendly dinner plan and shopping list to `output/`.

## Repo Structure

- `main.py` – Orchestrator using `mcp-agent`.
- `mcp_agent.config.yaml` – Configuration for MCP servers and models.
- `task.md` – High-level task description for the orchestrator.
- `plan.md` – Execution plan generated by the orchestrator.
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies.

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
